# About the Guide

This supplement to the film takes an interdisciplinary approach. It places Carola’s narrative in a historical context and connects her experience to current events. The guide prompts students to consider how we evaluate information, and how we remember and commemorate the past. This guide serves as a standalone unit or as an addition to existing curriculum.

Contains graded prompts, optional activities, and an annotated bibliography.

Consists of five discr​ete​ sections for teachers to select from:

**SECTION 1: An Overview of the Holocaust with Timeline**  
**SECTION 2: Carola’s Life**  
 _Provides a specific context for Carola’s experience, including a summary of what it was like to be a Jewish child under Hitler’s rule. This section prompts students to consider the power of community ties and the impact of social exclusion._  
**SECTION 3: Carola’s Story in Today’s World**  
_Examines Germany’s humanitarian response to the Syrian immigration crisis._  
**SECTION 4: The Power of Commemorative Art**  
_Examines commemorative art as related to the imagery in the film, prompting discussion of how we remember the past._  
**SECTION 5: The Student as Historian**  
_Considers the usefulness of oral histories and documentaries as historical tools._
