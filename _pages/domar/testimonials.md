{% include quote text="I have organized a number of forums here at the Concord Museum and in my two decades at the Kennedy Library—but none have been more satisfying and touching than the screening of <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Exile and Community</span> and the ensuing discussion.  I hope the film gets the wide viewership it deserves, especially among students since the scenes that are so poignant are those of Carola as a young girl in Germany and then the manner in which she was welcomed home by students at the school she once attended." attribution="Tom Putman, Edward W. Kane Executive Director, Concord Museum, Concord, MA

## Comments from viewers:

{% include quote text="I am so glad I got the chance to get to know Carola Domar." %}

{% include quote text="What a remarkable story!" %}

{% include quote text="This story of a Holocaust survivor is different than any that I have ever viewed before. The theme of forgiveness is very strong and is a good way to carry on discussion with students." %}

{% include quote text="Very informative documentary about the life of one Holocaust survivor. Excellent, found myself wanting more." %}

{% include quote text="[What stood out is] how Carola found her own voice at the end of her life." %}

{% include quote text="Carola's life and experiences were fascinating and inspiring. As an educator, I can foresee a number of ways to introduce this material into the curriculum. I am eager to integrate the film and any accompanying materials in my classes. I know it will be of great interest to my students. Thank you all so much for working on this project and bringing it to the public arena." %}

{% include quote text="Well-done! The film was so moving and well-conceived––loved the music and how the chapters of Carola’s life were organized. What an inspiration she was! I watched with my 97-year-old mom––born and raised in the US––but very much Carola’s contemporary which made the history portrayed through Carola’s individual autobiography all the more meaningful to both of us. My mom said it represented a perspective on the Holocaust that she had not known about before." %}


## Comments from educators:

{% include quote text="<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Exile and Community</span> is an important teaching tool for middle- and secondary-school students. Carola tells her life story with warmth, colour, and an eye for detail. Through her description, the viewer can imagine her as a young girl, subject to a bewildering onslaught of humiliation, insult, and persecution. Because Carola was able to leave Germany and make a good life for her and her family in the United States, the viewer is spared a focus on the most horrific and unimaginable aspects of the Holocaust. The result is an engaging film that evokes deep empathy without being emotionally overwhelming." attribution="Derek Penslar, William Lee Frost Professor of Jewish History, Harvard University" %}

{% include quote text="Congratulations to all on Susan Rieder’s excellent documentary film, <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Exile and Community: The Life of Carola Domar</span> and its comprehensive accompanying Teacher's Guide. It has been a pleasure working with Sue on this project and watching this wonderful teaching resource on tolerance, memory, Holocaust, and refugees come to fruition." attribution="James E. Young, Teacher’s Guide Advisor, Distinguished University Professor Emeritus, Founding Director, Institute for Holocaust, Genocide, and Memory Studies, University of Massachusetts, Amherst" %}

{% include quote text="The Teacher's Guide to <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Exile and Community: The Life of Carola Domar</span> is a wonderful pedagogic resource. It beautifully accomplishes the difficult feat of making top-notch scholarship completely accessible to teachers and students alike.  
In addition to meeting its goal of providing context and learning activities that will help students get the most out of the film’s story—the story of the experience of a Jew in Nazi Germany—the Guide also valuably engages with the politics and ethics of representing that experience.  Teachers will especially benefit in this regard from the substantive sections on commemorative art and the student as historian." attribution="Dorothy J. Hale, Teacher's Guide Editor, Professor of English, University of California, Berkeley" %}

{% include quote text="Many congratulations on the publication! The guide is exceptionally well researched, designed, and written. A thoughtfully prepared and rich resource for teachers and students, it will be of good use in any classroom where historical depth, lived experience, and reflection on our own times are valued. I look forward to using parts of it in my own teaching, and I am deeply honored that I could contribute to its production in some small ways." attribution="Sebastian Wogenstein, Teacher's Guide Editor, Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature, University of Connecticut, Storrs" %}

{% include quote text="<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Exile and Community: The Life of Carola Domar</span> is a moving testament to the harrowing decisions that confronted Jewish families in Nazi Germany and the challenges of rebuilding a life in exile. By presenting the rise of Nazism and the persecution of Germany's Jewish community from the point of view of a teenage girl, the film makes these complex and often confusing events accessible to students. The teacher's guide provides historical context for the film, and will help teachers relate the film's themes of exile, commemoration, forgiveness, and moral responsibility to student's own experiences and the problems of our world today." attribution="Brandon Bloch, Teacher's Guide Contributing Author, Assistant Professor of History, University of Wisconsin, Madison" %}

{% include quote text="<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Exile and Community: The Life of Carola Domar</span> film and guide are excellent resources for educators.  Carola’s story resonates with students and allows them to consider the challenges and choices that Carola and her family faced in Nazi Germany. The guide provides thought-provoking lesson ideas and discussion questions. It is designed to provide options for teachers depending on the time they have available, the level of their students, and the topics on which they want to focus. The questions in the guide push students to evaluate historical events, make connections to the present day, and to address difficult and important topics such as forgiveness, memory, and memorial.  Students will benefit tremendously from the opportunity to hear Carola’s inspiring story in her own words." attribution="Johanna Glazer, Teacher's Guide Editor, Social Studies Teacher, Concord-Carlisle High School, Concord, MA" %}

{% include quote text="Learning about the great injustices of history, like the Holocaust, can often seem daunting or so far removed from today's middle school student's experience as to be dismissed.  However, now more than ever it's imperative to teach young people how to think critically about the Holocaust and its lessons regarding our shared humanity.  The Domar film and Teacher's Guide helps accomplish these goals in a way especially suited to middle school students by humanizing the Holocaust; by sharing Carola's experiences, her joys and pain, students can relate to her and better understand not just the tragedy of the Holocaust but also the resilience of the human spirit." attribution="Sarah Bullwinkel, Teacher's Guide Editor, English Teacher and Dept. Chair, Concord Middle School, Concord, MA" %}

{% include quote text="Looking through the teaching guide I was really impressed. In my opinion the documentary and the corresponding teaching guide are of much value, precisely because the story of Carola is not the more typical and tragic one of a German-Jewish family excluded, persecuted and annihilated in the Shoah by fellow human beings – but her history is the much rarer tale of an extraordinary young woman surviving exclusion and persecution by her own strength, finding a second start and a new life after being cast out from her former homeland and community. Because of that it deserves telling to a younger generation. Susan Rieder did a wonderful thing in making this possible." attribution="Lieven Wölk, Teacher's Guide Editor, PhD candidate, Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich Scholarship Fund, German History and the History of National Socialism in the 20th Century, Humboldt University, Berlin
