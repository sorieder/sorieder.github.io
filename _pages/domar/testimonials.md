# Testimonials

## Comments from sponsors:
{% include quote text="We chose to co-sponsor the documentary Exile and Community: The Life of Carola Domar because it offers a view of a story of struggle in a human way that resonates with struggles today. This documentary does a wonderful job of raising questions of identity and belonging and the human need to be connected. Seeing it would benefit students no matter where they live." attribution="Judi Bohn, Facing History, Special Projects Coordinator, New England, May 2019

{% include quote text="I have organized a number of forums here at the Concord Museum and in my two decades at the Kennedy Library—but none have been more satisfying and touching than the screening of Exile and Community and the ensuing discussion.  I hope the film gets the wide viewership it deserves, especially among students since the scenes that are so poignant are those of Carola as a young girl in Germany and then the manner in which she was welcomed home by students at the school she once attended." attribution="Tom Putman, Concord Museum, Edward W. Kane Executive Director, Concord, MA

{% include quote text="I am so glad I got the chance to get to know Carola Domar." %}

{% include quote text="What a remarkable story!" %}

{% include quote text="This story of a Holocaust survivor is different than any that I have ever viewed before. The theme of forgiveness is very strong and is a good way to carry on discussion with students." %}

{% include quote text="Very informative documentary about the life of one Holocaust survivor. Excellent, found myself wanting more." %}

{% include quote text="[What stood out is] how Carola found her own voice at the end of her life." %}

{% include quote text="Carola's life and experiences were fascinating and inspiring. As an educator, I can foresee a number of ways to introduce this material into the curriculum. I am eager to integrate the film and any accompanying materials in my classes. I know it will be of great interest to my students. Thank you all so much for working on this project and bringing it to the public arena." %}

{% include quote text="Well-done! The film was so moving and well-conceived––loved the music and how the chapters of Carola’s life were organized. What an inspiration she was! I watched with my 97-year-old mom––born and raised in the US––but very much Carola’s contemporary which made the history portrayed through Carola’s individual autobiography all the more meaningful to both of us. My mom said it represented a perspective on the Holocaust that she had not known about before." %}
