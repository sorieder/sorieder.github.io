## Susan Orleans Rieder
Susan has a background in history and art. She holds an MA in Art History from the University of California, Berkeley, and has worked at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Harvard University Art Museums. Her research focused on the social context of late nineteenth-century French photography and posters. This work has helped inform Susanâ€™s approach to visual narratives and to historical subjects in video. Her interest in oral histories began one summer, as a researcher in England, when she became intrigued by a collection of late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century accounts of family life in the British Library. Her introduction to filmmaking began as a researcher for the art history filmmaker Judith Weschler. Susan is grateful for her creative collaboration with Sam Krueger, an editor and director of photography.
