## Synopsis

![image-left](/assets/images/domar_young_p_xs.jpg){: .align-left}

Carola Domar was a high-spirited, resourceful individual with generous instincts, caught in a tumultuous time. As a young Jew in Nazi Germany, Carola yearned for social acceptance and for the German identity she once took for granted. She escaped in her teens and came to the U.S. on her own. Carola spent much of her life searching for a specific kind of community––one connected to nature and guided by modernist ideals––and ultimately found it in Concord, MA, a New England town outside Boston. Carola’s experience is all the more remarkable because her spirit of forgiveness ultimately helped her to come to terms with her past and reconnect with her former homeland.

Her story of exile and community has particular relevance in the context of current mass migration and anti-semitism. This film is conceived as an educational tool, primarily for young people, who will relate to Carola’s account of what it was like to be a teen in Nazi Germany. The hope is to provide a heightened awareness of both the Holocaust and the power of reconciliation.

Carola's experience is presented as two interwoven narratives drawn from a 1998 USC Shoah Foundation Institute interview of Carola Domar, and a more recent interview undertaken by this filmmaker of her daughter, Alice Domar. This perspective on a well-known era underscores Carola’s youthful view of events, particularly since this story is set in the familiar world of school and sports, and speaks to the fears of social exclusion most teens experience.

This film is more than a Holocaust story. Carola Domar went on to live a joyful life, with deliberation and grace, in an idealistic community she helped forge. And her compassion extended beyond her immediate sphere. She also embraced the place and people that had once ostracized her, reconciling with perpetrators of the Holocaust through the organization One by One and giving talks in Germany. In a final gesture, shortly before she passed away, Carola returned to the Frankfurt school where she had flourished as a leader and athlete, and from which she had been expelled for being a Jew, to attend a commemoration of forgiveness and remembrance.

Completed May 2016. <br /> **Run time:** 60 minutes

**SECTION 2: Carola’s Life**  
 _Provides a specific context for Carola’s experience, including a summary of what it was like to be a Jewish child under Hitler’s rule. This section prompts students to consider the power of community ties and the impact of social exclusion._  
**SECTION 3: Carola’s Story in Today’s World**  
_Examines Germany’s humanitarian response to the Syrian immigration crisis._  
**SECTION 4: The Power of Commemorative Art**

# Testimonials

## Comments from sponsors:
>“We chose to co-sponsor the documentary Exile and Community: The Life of Carola Domar because it offers a view of a story of struggle in a human way that resonates with struggles today. This documentary does a wonderful job of raising questions of identity and belonging and the human need to be connected. Seeing it would benefit students no matter where they live.”

>“I have organized a number of forums here at the Concord Museum and in my two decades at the Kennedy Library—but none have been more satisfying and touching than the screening of Exile and Community and the ensuing discussion.  I hope the film gets the wide viewership it deserves, especially among students since the scenes that are so poignant are those of Carola as a young girl in Germany and then the manner in which she was welcomed home by students at the school she once attended.”

## Comments from viewers:

>“What a remarkable story!”

>“This story of a Holocaust survivor is different than any that I have ever viewed before. The theme of forgiveness is very strong and is a good way to carry on discussion with students.”

>“Very informative documentary about the life of one Holocaust survivor. Excellent, found myself wanting more.”

>“[What stood out is] how Carola found her own voice at the end of her life.”

>“Carola's life and experiences were fascinating and inspiring. As an educator, I can foresee a number of ways to introduce this material into the curriculum. I am eager to integrate the film and any accompanying materials in my classes. I know it will be of great interest to my students. Thank you all so much for working on this project and bringing it to the public arena.”

>“Well-done! The film was so moving and well-conceived––loved the music and how the chapters of Carola’s life were organized. What an inspiration she was! I watched with my 97-year-old mom––born and raised in the US––but very much Carola’s contemporary which made the history portrayed through Carola’s individual autobiography all the more meaningful to both of us. My mom said it represented a perspective on the Holocaust that she had not known about before.”
